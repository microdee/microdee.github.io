## Change Windows screen resolution via scripts
[(10.07.2020)](/c/log/change-resolution-script)

I have an annoying situation that my laptop has a gorgeous 4K OLED screen (oh the suffering), but it doesn't exactly have the graphics power to drive games on that resolution. "It's fine just set the resolution in your game and your non-problem is solved" I hear you say. But there's a slight problem with that. Many games actually use fake borderless fullscreen, which has 2 possible problems:

1. The swapchain is still created at native desktop resolution and ReShade would still render at 4K while the output image should be only 1080p (like Unity games for example)
2. Many programs (including Source games for example) are not handling DPI scaling of windows properly because it's a legacy-compatibility riddled clusterfuck (I've been there, still gives me tremors). As a result the borderless "fullscreen" window is not exactly covering the entire screen, or overshoots a bit.

So to avoid these issues I've been just switching resolutions via the Display Properties, but that's too many clicks, and cumbersome/lame. So I've gone googling for a Powershell solution. Via stack Overflow I found [Andy Schneider's solution](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/2a631d72-206d-4036-a3f2-2e150f297515). Then I realized: hold on a second, this is not Powershell, this is C# with a Power-shell *(badumtsss)*. Although this script is 10 years old and C# back then wasn't exactly that instant to use so I guess that's why.

But it doesn't stop me to slap it on [dotnet-script](https://github.com/filipw/dotnet-script) and run them from a folder I also add to `PATH`. So this is my setup:

```
- folder
  - SetResolution.csx
  - Set1080p.csx
  - Set4K.csx
```

First initialize the folder with dotnet-script so VS Code can do useful auto-completition

```
dotnet script init
```

Then make the `SetResolution.csx` (slightly modified to work with dotnet script)

``` CSharp
using System; 
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

    static public string ChangeResolution(int width, int height) 
    { 

        DEVMODE1 dm = GetDevMode1(); 

        if (0 != User_32.EnumDisplaySettings(null, User_32.ENUM_CURRENT_SETTINGS, ref dm)) 
        { 

            dm.dmPelsWidth = width; 
            dm.dmPelsHeight = height; 

            int iRet = User_32.ChangeDisplaySettings(ref dm, User_32.CDS_TEST); 

            if (iRet == User_32.DISP_CHANGE_FAILED) 
            { 
                return "Unable To Process Your Request. Sorry For This Inconvenience."; 
            } 
            else 
            { 
                iRet = User_32.ChangeDisplaySettings(ref dm, User_32.CDS_UPDATEREGISTRY); 
                switch (iRet) 
                { 
                    case User_32.DISP_CHANGE_SUCCESSFUL: 
                        { 
                            return "Success"; 
                        } 
                    case User_32.DISP_CHANGE_RESTART: 
                        { 
                            return "You Need To Reboot For The Change To Happen.\n If You Feel Any Problem After Rebooting Your Machine\nThen Try To Change Resolution In Safe Mode."; 
                        } 
                    default: 
                        { 
                            return "Failed To Change The Resolution"; 
                        } 
                } 

            } 


        } 
        else 
        { 
            return "Failed To Change The Resolution."; 
        } 
    } 

    private static DEVMODE1 GetDevMode1() 
    { 
        DEVMODE1 dm = new DEVMODE1(); 
        dm.dmDeviceName = new String(new char[32]); 
        dm.dmFormName = new String(new char[32]); 
        dm.dmSize = (short)Marshal.SizeOf(dm); 
        return dm; 
    } 
}
```

And finally the `Set*.csx` scripts:

``` CSharp
// Set1080p.csx
#load "SetResolution.csx"

PrimaryScreenResolution.ChangeResolution(1920, 1080);
```

Then just run those scripts from anywhere (assuming you've added the main folder to PATH) if you've associated CSX files with dotnet script properly. If you still need powershell you can do this:

``` powershell
# Set1080p.ps1
dotnet script "$PSScriptRoot\Set1080p.csx"
```

dotnet-script also gives you the ability to compile DLL's from CSX files in which case the PS script would look something like this:

``` powershell
# Set1080p.ps1
Add-Type -Path "$PSScriptRoot\SetResolution.dll"
[PrimaryScreenResolution]::ChangeResolution(1920, 1080)
```

Well that was a sudden brain-fart, I've spent some 20 minutes on, bye!
