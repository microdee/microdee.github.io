# Comments!

[(09.07.2021)](/c/log/comments)

Now you can too express your exclusive disappointment in my stuff on select articles on this website. Because this website is already using 0 services and 0 servers (on its own anyway), the commenting is powered by [Utterances](https://utteranc.es/) which is fetching comments from a Github repository's issues.

What a time to be alive!
