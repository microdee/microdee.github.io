# YO!

(31.05.2020)

I started to improve this website beyond just a static html portfolio for my works, which was very tedious to update frequently. This changes today! What you're looking at is my attempt at making an article engine which can be hosted on a static server (this is hosted on a github.io page for example), and all the "smartness" (aka. Work) should happen on your computer instead.

Because I'm working with more barebones tools now, a lot of eye-candy has been lost in the process, but the result should be more focused and should have a more unique and consistent look. And of course now it has a much broader purpose than listing my varyingly outdated works I've done in the past. From now on, if I find time, I'll write a devblog here, about random topics I encounter during my daily life and I find it interesting enough to write about it.

Why not use a service for this or a social media surface? Excellent question hypothetical Reader, who might even be a real person!

[Works](/c/works) and [Software](/c/ware) sections are getting filled up to represent reality. But they're not complete yet.

Articles are written in markdown (rendered with [React-Markdown](https://github.com/rexxars/react-markdown)) referenced with url transformation using [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/). I started from [this boilerplate](https://github.com/rafrex/react-github-pages) apparently last committed to 4 years ago, needless to say a lot of its bells-and-whistles needed updates.

[Go to the test page](/c/test) to see what this thing can do.

## Cheers! And see you soon™
