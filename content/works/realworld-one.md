This was a full-time employment where I was working on constantly improving and expanding the internal in-house middle-ware, platform infrastructure and XR hardware implementations with a team of excellent fellow C++ engineers. This is not a singular project like the rest of the items on this page, but rather an on-going product realworld-one makes.
