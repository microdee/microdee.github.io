# Unreal plugins

## Uranium

![md.center](ware/ur_logo_atom_ondark.png)

![md.parallax md.not-in-article](uelogo.svg)

The fastest full CEF implementation for UE4 so far.

### [Get it](https://github.com/microdee/Uranium)

* Use mostly everything what CEF can offer, translated to an Unreal friendly API.
* Off-screen rendering result is retrieved through a shared texture on graphics memory. This means no rendering overhead for high resolution HTML content.
  * Above allows to have Browser Atlas pipeline: a large canvas of HTML is used to render many in-game UI elements, just like a regular texture atlas.
* Full multitouch capability.
* Integration into Unreal's own audio system.
* UMG abstraction layer, a full fledged browser widget.

**Recently open-sourced. It started development at [MESO](https://meso.design)**  
**Now being developed at [realworld one](https://realworld-one.com/)**  
A lot of enhancements and features are planned, but the basic components are already usable.
