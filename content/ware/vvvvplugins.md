## mp.dx
and mp.essentials

A large collection of general purpose nodes and ecosystems. Think of it as a second addonpack. It also includes as dependencies:

* **[mp.fxh](https://github.com/microdee/mp.fxh)** a HLSL header library tackling many common problems
* **[mp.pddn](https://github.com/microdee/mp.pddn)** a library to ease manipulation of nodes and pins in vvvv.
* **[md.stdl](https://github.com/microdee/md.stdl)** a C# standard library of misc things.
  * This is being deprecated tho in favor of its .NET Core port which doesn't rely on VVVV.Utils anymore
