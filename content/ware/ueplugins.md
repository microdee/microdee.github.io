# Coming Soon™

## BlueKinect

Industry-proof and versatile implementation of Azure Kinect into UE4. Main features are:

* Support for any number of local or remote devices.
* Support for any number of tracked people.
* Zero-config network discovery and sharing data of remote Kinect Azure devices.
  * Especially engineered with nDisplay clusters in mind, however BlueKinect doesn't use nDisplay event system. It uses its own UDP communication.
* MVP pattern for Kinect's input data, with runtime, dynamic templates for presenter/view classes.
* View classes and utilities for avateering skeletal meshes.
* Retrieve camera images efficiently. Upload only color and raw depth to graphics memory from Kinect Azure SDK, calculate the rest with compute-shaders.
  * (images are not yet shared across the network)

**Currently being developed at MESO.**  
It's already used and well tested in one of our large-scale interactive projects at MESO.

## BlueWindow

Manage multiple UMG windows from Blueprint and other UI related features.

* Create windows managed by an actor component. It's being used for multi-display scenarios, where nDisplay would be too bloaty, or too attended.
* Utilities for complex multitouch interactions.
* UMG utilities for better preview at design time.

**Currently being developed at MESO.**  
It's already being used almost in all of our complete and running projects at MESO.

## Uranium

The fastest full CEF implementation for UE4 so far, embracing recent features of CEF's Off-screen rendering mode.

* Use mostly everything what CEF can offer, translated to an Unreal friendly API.
* Off-screen rendering result is retrieved through a shared texture on graphics memory. This means no rendering overhead for high resolution HTML content.
  * Above allows to have Browser Atlas pipeline: a large canvas of HTML is used to render many in-game UI elements, just like a regular texture atlas.
* Full multitouch capability.
* Integration into Unreal's own audio system.
* UMG abstraction layer, a full fledged browser widget.

**Currently being developed at MESO.**  
It's currently at proof-of-concept stage. Due to the backlash of public showcases caused by the 2020 pandemic, further development of this plugin is on hold.
