* Use mostly everything what CEF can offer, translated to an Unreal friendly API.
* Off-screen rendering result is retrieved through a shared texture on graphics memory. This means no rendering overhead for high resolution HTML content.
  * Above allows to have Browser Atlas pipeline: a large canvas of HTML is used to render many in-game UI elements, just like a regular texture atlas.
* Full multitouch capability.
* Integration into Unreal's own audio system.
* UMG abstraction layer, a full fledged browser widget.

**Recently open-sourced. It started development at [MESO](https://meso.design)**  
Currently this is under major redesign.
